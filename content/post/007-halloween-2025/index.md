Today is yet another day humans will celebrate something with one-off products. Not bothering what happens to the products after they are used.

They go the waste, right? Or may be you recycle them? And then, they *eventually* go to the waste, right? Right.

Did you you know that the [amount of plastic is greater than all land animals and marine animals combined](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/dec/09/human-made-materials-now-outweigh-earths-entire-biomass-study)?

Well, plastic has become unavoidable. Yet, we can reduce single-purpose plastics as far as possible.

But how do I celebrate without dressing up?

This raises two questions:

1. How was Halloween celebrated historically?
2. Can I still do a kinda-modern celebration without creating waste?

The first is an interesting question. A quick read at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloween) tells us *"Wearing costumes and playing pranks at Halloween did not spread to England until the 20th century."* Roughly, consumerism is a very recent century or two old phenomena compared to the human history of several thousand years. [This](https://animalarchaeology.com/2018/10/31/terror-and-tradition-over-time-a-look-at-the-material-culture-of-halloween/) might be a nice read.

I still don't know what exactly a *traditional Halloween celebration* looks like? I'm told I should visit rural or semi-urban areas of Europe to find out.

There's some nice [waste statistics on Modern Halloween](https://www.wastemanaged.co.uk/our-news/halloween/halloween-waste/) by WasteManaged.

As for the second question, there are plenty of guides once you start searching, for example, [this article by Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicasanders/2025/10/27/5-ways-to-have-a-sustainable-spooky-season/).

PS: If you created waste this year, that's something to keep in mind for the upcoming celebrations! Be it Christmas, New Year, or the next Halloween! Or any other festivals you celebrate!
