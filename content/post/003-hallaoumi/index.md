Yesterday, I had a burger that reminded me of [Indian Paneer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paneer). Indian Paneer is inturn different from [Turkish Peynir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyaz_peynir) as I learnt from another friend. Upon checking the ingredients, this something in the Burger turned out to be [Halloumi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halloumi) with an origin in Cyprus.

Though, I might be gravely mistaken to think Halloumi is in anyway similar to Paneer given [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetarian/comments/t9gwbg/paneer_vs_halloumi/) 😶‍🌫️
