I recently received an email from one of my professors titled *Some non-obvious advice for psych graduate students*. I wanted to share it publicly, but found no obvious public links in the email that was forwarded from one of Substack's mailing list. Though, after inspecting the url for Varun Shennoy's substack `varunshenoy.substack.com` this morning, the critical part seemed to be obtaining some *username*, and then the website should be at `<username>.substack.com`. And there it was `paulbloom.substack.com` that I could share publicly. Enough Meta!

If you are a psychology graduate student (or perhaps even a postdoctoral researcher or someone in their early career), definitely check it out!

Another of Paul Bloom's post I liked and can suggest reading is

To be honest, that's a strong take. I think from an interdisciplinary research perspective, it still makes sense. However, I also think there's more to interdisciplinary research. I should share an article I had found another day; it's a tangential topic on philosophy of interdisciplinary research rather than advice for graduate school.

Coming back to graduate school advice, I had come across a book last year. I suspect it was this, but it could be different. It is slighly hefty at 400+ pages, but given that they are plain english rather than academic jargon, it should be an easy read over lunch hours or a weekend or two. Goodreads reviewers rate it quite highly.
