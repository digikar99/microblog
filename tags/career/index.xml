Here it is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has pretty much kept being updated for the last&amp;hellip; 8 years(!)&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Advice for (Psychology) Graduate Students</title><link>https://digikar99.github.io/microblog/p/graduate-advice/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Oct 2025 08:45:32 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://digikar99.github.io/microblog/p/graduate-advice/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I recently received an email from one of my professors titled &lt;em&gt;Some non-obvious advice for psych graduate students&lt;/em&gt;. I wanted to share it publicly, but found no obvious public links in the email that was forwarded from one of Substack&amp;rsquo;s mailing list. Though, after inspecting the url for Varun Shennoy&amp;rsquo;s substack &lt;code&gt;varunshenoy.substack.com&lt;/code&gt; this morning, the critical part seemed to be obtaining some &lt;em&gt;username&lt;/em&gt;, and then the website should be at &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;.substack.com&lt;/code&gt;. And there it was &lt;code&gt;paulbloom.substack.com&lt;/code&gt; that I could share publicly. Enough Meta!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a psychology graduate student (or perhaps even a postdoctoral researcher or someone in their early career), definitely check it out!&lt;/p&gt;

Some non-obvious advice for psych graduate students
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another of Paul Bloom&amp;rsquo;s post I liked and can suggest reading is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
&lt;a class="link" href="https://smallpotatoes.paulbloom.net/p/the-only-interdisciplinary-conversations"&gt;
The only interdisciplinary conversations worth having
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To be honest, that&amp;rsquo;s a strong take. I think from an interdisciplinary research perspective, it still makes sense. However, I also think there&amp;rsquo;s more to interdisciplinary research. I should share an article I had found another day; it&amp;rsquo;s a tangential topic on philosophy of interdisciplinary research rather than advice for graduate school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coming back to graduate school advice, I had come across a book last year. I suspect it was this, but it could be different. It is slighly hefty at 400+ pages, but given that they are plain english rather than academic jargon, it should be an easy read over lunch hours or a weekend or two. Goodreads reviewers rate it quite highly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Don't major in Computer Science!</title><link>https://digikar99.github.io/microblog/p/no-computer-science/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Oct 2025 23:09:57 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://digikar99.github.io/microblog/p/no-computer-science/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;From time to time, I regret majoring in computer science and not something heavier in mathematics. Today was one such day ðŸ¥². It remains one of the biggest regrets of my life. Alas, what is done is done. Grass is always greener on the other side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="link" href="https://varunshenoy.substack.com/p/dont-major-in-computer-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
&gt;This post by Varun Shenoy&lt;/a&gt; sums it quite well. If you are young, and have an option, choose anything but computer science. And particularly, don&amp;rsquo;t go into computer science in order to learn programming. Programming is the bread and butter of 21st century, but this means it is a fundamental skill&amp;hellip; like english. You don&amp;rsquo;t become excited just because you know english. You need other skills, english is just a medium of communication (with other english-speakers). You need other skills, programming is just a means of communication (with the computer).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t also go into computer science in order to pursue higher studies in computer science. The research part of computer science can be fairly heavy in mathematics, so I&amp;rsquo;m biased to say that an applied-math major would be better. Of course, you can start an undergraduation in computer science and fill it up with mathematics heavy topics, but why not acquire a proper mathematics background in the first place then.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
