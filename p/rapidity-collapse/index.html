Science provides the <em>how to</em> of reasoning over nature. The <em>over what</em> are the specific scenarios that occur in the particular natural habitat. It doesn&rsquo;t take rocket science to realize that the release of trapped $CO_2$, methane, or microbes can pose a threat as a mine is excavated. However, no amount of science can tell us that <em>there is</em> trapped $CO_2$, methane or microbes in the mine. That requires <em>exploring</em> or inspecting the environment. Furthermore, <em>can</em> pose a threat does not mean <em>will</em> pose a threat. And again, lacking omniscience, it is not possible to make perfect predictions.</p><p>Rapid resource extraction &ndash; which does not bother or even denies inspecting the side-effects of the particular resource extraction &ndash; will thus <em>eventually</em> lead to environmental collapse. It would merely be luck that a civilization survives any particular length of rapid resource extraction.</p><p><em>How rapid?</em></p><p>Rapid enough that the resulting environmental collapse triggers events on a scale the civilization cannot deal with.

At the same time, it should develop its scientific understanding as well as explore its environment to better understand the effects of particular resource extractions. As the knowledge of these effects becomes available, only then, should it extract the resources. However, it will be competing against the cosmic events. But hopefully, &ldquo;industrialization and modernization&rdquo; over a span of 40,000 years rather than 400 years can easily be a sweet spot that does both</p><ol><li>Develop tools to overcome the cosmic event.</li><li>Don&rsquo;t harm oneself or go extinct by environmental collapse triggered by rapid resource extraction.</li></ol><center>Slow down.</center><p><a class=link href=https://discuss.leeds.ac.uk/2020/02/26/food-inequality-humanitys-biggest-moral-failure/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Extremely unequal distribution of resources not insufficiency</a> is the <a class=link href=https://blogs.egu.eu/geolog/2025/07/11/the-false-narrative-of-over-population-why-malthus-had-it-wrong-when-it-comes-to-global-resources/ target=_blank rel=noopener>root of modern global problems</a>.</p><blockquote><p>the richest 1% of humanity now produce as much carbon as the poorest two-thirds combined. Likewise, the top 10% of emitters account for half of all global $CO_2$</p></blockquote><p>The civilization must optimize the use of its resources to meet the needs of its individuals and develop science and environmental knowledge while <em>trying</em> not to extract further resources. Any growth, development, or betterment that stems from resource extraction instead of optimization is a short-sighted move that <span style=color:red;text-decoration:line-through>can</span> <span style=color:green>will</span> pose an extinction threat to the civilization.</p><p>Note that resource optimization has to be carried out at the scale of civilization, particularly amongst its top resource extractors. Resource optimization amongst the bottom resource extractors without the top is futile. In case this is not obvious, suppose:</p><ul><li>Group A comprising 1 billion people consume 90 units of a resource</li><li>Group B comprising 9 billion people consume 10 units of a resource</li></ul><p>Combined, the two groups consume 100 units of the resource.</p><p>What will happen if group B starts consuming 50% less resources?

However -</p><ul><li>Group A will still consume 90 units</li><li>Group B will consume 5 units</li></ul><p>Combined, the two groups still consume 95 units of the resource. The resource saving is a mere 5%, extraordinarily different from the intuition generated by &ldquo;90% people consuming 50% less resources&rdquo;.</p><p>What will happen if <em>group A</em> starts consuming 50% less resources?</p><ul><li>Group A will consume 45 units</li><li>Group B will continue to consume 10 units</li></ul><p>Combined, the two groups consume 55 units of the resource! A conservation of 45% resources is resulted from merely 10% of the top resource extractors cutting their extractions in half.</p><p>Inequality itself is not a problem; extreme inequality of the above kind is. It is not a mere &ldquo;problem of ethics&rdquo; we can disagree over but a &ldquo;survival problem&rdquo; that will kill everyone.
